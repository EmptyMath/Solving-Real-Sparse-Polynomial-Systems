# Sparse-Systems
Here you can find a prototype that can solve sparse polynomial systems using the software Matlab and SeDuMi.

The is new software Moment_Appraoch_A available. The names of the functions are unchanged but there are new rank constraints in order to increase the accuracy of the solutions in exchange for the running time. One must still download the other functions contained in Solver Sparse.
