# Solving-Real-Sparse-Polynomial-Systems
Here you can find a prototype that can solve sparse polynomial systems using the software Matlab and SeDuMi.

We present two algorithms for solving polynomial equations. The two main functions are Moment_Appraoch_A(_standard). These functions are capable of solving polynomial equations. For more information consult the read me pdf.
